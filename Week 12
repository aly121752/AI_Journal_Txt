I used AI to help with my research and to debug problems I was running into. When I was working on background information for my project, I asked the AI to explain complex topics, break down terminology, and summarize key concepts so I could understand them better and continue researching more efficiently. I also used it to troubleshoot issues in my code by sharing the errors I was facing and asking for clarification on why certain functions weren’t working as expected. The AI suggested possible causes and offered step-by-step fixes, which helped me identify mistakes faster and learn how to approach debugging more logically.
