AI Journal Week 5

This week I continued using AI in similar ways to last week, primarily to help me study and prepare for upcoming exams. I used it to review new concepts from my classes by breaking down complex topics into simpler explanations and generating practice questions to test my understanding. AI also helped me organize study notes and summarize key information from lectures and readings, which made studying more efficient.

The main new way I used AI this week was for a coding project. I asked AI to suggest new ideas for improving my code and to help debug a few problems I was running into. This was particularly useful because it provided clear explanations of errors and suggested alternative solutions I hadnâ€™t considered. It also helped me understand the logic behind the fixes, rather than just providing answers.

Overall, my use of AI this week stayed consistent with previous weeks, supporting my learning and preparation for exams, but expanded slightly to include more hands-on coding support.
