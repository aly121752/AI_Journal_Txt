INST326 Journal 3

This week, I used AI in ways very similar to last week, but with a few new applications. Since I have exams coming up, one of the main ways I relied on AI was to help me summarize lecture slides into more concise study notes. This made it easier to review large amounts of material quickly and focus on the most important points.

I also used AI to go over questions I had gotten wrong in practice. Instead of just seeing the right answer, I asked AI to explain why my answer was incorrect and to break down the reasoning behind the correct choice. This really helped me understand the material on a deeper level.

Finally, I used AI to debug a few of the problems I ran into while working on the Week 3 exercises. I was a little confused at certain parts, so I asked AI to explain not only what was wrong but also how to approach debugging in general. This made it much easier to work through the errors and understand the logic behind the solutions.

Overall, AI was a useful tool again this week for summarizing, reviewing, explaining mistakes, and even debugging code.
