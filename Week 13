AI Journal Week 13 

Over the past few weeks, I have been using AI as a major tool to help me study for my finals. It has helped me break down difficult concepts from classes like chemistry, biology, and database design into simple explanations that I can understand more easily. Whenever I get stuck on a problem or don’t know how to start, I use AI to guide me through step-by-step solutions. I’ve also used it to review class materials, summarize lecture notes, and clarify topics that I struggled with during the semester. Overall, AI has made my study process much more organized and less stressful.

I have also used AI to create personalized practice exams and quiz-style questions that match the format of my upcoming tests. This has helped me test my understanding and identify which areas I still need to review before the actual exam. I often ask AI to generate different types of problems—multiple choice, short answer, and calculation-based—to make sure I’m practicing in a realistic way. Using these practice questions helps me build confidence and become more familiar with how to approach exam-style problems. By using AI as a study partner, I feel more prepared and focused as I get ready for finals.
