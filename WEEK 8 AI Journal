WEEK 8 AI Journal

This week, I used AI to support my coursework by helping me study, complete assignments, debug code, and improve group projects. It helped me review complex topics in chemistry and biology, such as redox reactions and cell transport, by simplifying explanations and providing practice problems. For assignments, I used AI to clarify instructions, analyze data, and understand statistics concepts like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. When coding in MySQL and Python, AI helped me identify and fix syntax and logic errors while explaining the reasoning behind each solution. It also guided my team in refining our ERD and developing user stories for our Class Connect app project. Overall, AI made my studying and project work more efficient, deepened my understanding of difficult concepts, and helped me stay organized and confident throughout the week.
