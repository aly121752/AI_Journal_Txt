Week 7 AI Journal

This week, I used AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini to help me learn coding concepts and prepare for my upcoming lab practical. I relied on ChatGPT to explain debugging strategies and generate unit tests for practice code, which helped me understand how to identify and fix logic errors more efficiently. It also walked me through how to test functions step by step, which made it easier to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in class to real examples. Gemini was useful for summarizing coding errors and pointing out syntax issues, although it sometimes lacked the deeper context I needed for my project. Overall, using AI this week improved my confidence in both writing and testing code. It also helped me review lab material by breaking down procedures and key concepts into simpler explanations, which made studying for the lab practical much less stressful and more organized.
