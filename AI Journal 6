Throughout this week, I used ChatGPT as a study and learning tool to prepare for several of my upcoming exams. Early in the week, I focused on my INST314 exam, where I needed help understanding how to code and apply concepts covered in class. The AI helped explain the logic behind the code step by step, which made it easier for me to connect theory with practical application. It also helped me identify areas I needed to review more deeply and provided examples that reinforced my understanding.

Later in the week, I used ChatGPT to study for my BSCI330 (Cell Biology) exam. I asked it to explain complex biological concepts like protein regulation, enzyme activity, and gene expression in simpler terms. It also generated practice questions and mock exam prompts, which helped me test my understanding and identify weak points before the actual test. The explanations it provided were clear and easy to follow, making difficult material more manageable.

Overall, using AI this week made studying more efficient and less stressful. It acted as both a tutor and a study partner, helping me review material at my own pace. I plan to continue using it to prepare for future exams, especially when I need concept clarification, practice problems, or help applying coding logic to real examples.
