This week, I used AI as an academic and technical support tool to improve both my studying and coding workflow. AI helped me break down complex course content — especially areas where I struggled to interpret terminology or understand the reasoning behind certain lab procedures and quiz questions. Being able to ask follow-up questions in real time made it easier to reinforce concepts rather than just memorizing them. AI also helped me review chemistry and biology topics by providing simplified explanations, example problems, and clarification when a solution didn’t make sense.

From a programming perspective, AI played a big role in helping me generate ideas and debug. When I worked on design-related assignments for the research data pipeline and library management system, AI helped me reason through the architecture instead of just giving me code. It helped me understand when to use composition versus inheritance and why certain patterns support flexibility and modularity. AI also helped expand my database thinking by guiding documentation strategies, breaking down schema problems, and walking me through class relationships with examples. Overall, AI allowed me to learn how to think through the problem rather than just copy a solution — and that made a big difference in both studying and coding confidence this week.
