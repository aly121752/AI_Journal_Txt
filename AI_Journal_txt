This week I used AI while studying for chemistry and biology. I asked ChatGPT to help me understand equilibrium, solubility, and Le Chatelierâ€™s Principle. I utilize AI to explain the concepts into simpler steps and giving me practice questions. I didn't use any AI to complete graded work directly, but I used it to clarify confusing material and double-check my reasoning..

I also used AI to prepare for a Greek mythology quiz. It helped me simplify key stories, characters, and themes from the Iliad.

Finally, I asked AI to walk me step by step through creating an AI_Journal.txt file on GitHub. This helped me understand how to create and update files directly in GitHub, as well as how to upload them from my computer. https://chatgpt.com/c/68c37cbb-90fc-832b-b70b-ee9c7820299e
