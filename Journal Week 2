Week 2 Jounral 9/17/2025

This week I have mostly used AI as a tool in order to study/prepare for my upcoming exams. SInce I have two exams next week, I wanted to make sure I reviewed the material in different ways. Therefore, I asked AI to explain concepts I was struggling with in simpler terms, and break down larger topics into smaller parts for me.
Alongside explaining concepts, I utilized AI to generate practice questions or practice tests. After a while, many of the practice questions provided can become repetitive. As a result, I use AI to create several types of questions (True or False, MC, or short answers) that allow me to study at an efficent rate.
As both of these methods are very efficent, it allows me to save time to study and understand several concepts at once.
