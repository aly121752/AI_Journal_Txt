Week 9 AI Journal 
11/12/25

This week, I used AI as a study companion to help me better understand and complete my coursework. I relied on it to review key concepts from my lab manual and prepare for quizzes, such as identifying enzyme reactions, substrates, and products in biochemistry. AI helped me clarify confusing material, summarize complex information, and double-check my reasoning before submitting assignments. I also used it to assist with homework explanations and to rewrite my responses into clearer, more concise paragraphs

Additionally, I used AI to debug a few programming problems I was struggling with. It guided me through identifying errors in my Python code, explained why certain logic wasn’t working, and suggested cleaner solutions that improved both my understanding and my code structure. Overall, AI has been a valuable resource for learning—helping me not just finish assignments, but actually understand the material and improve my problem-solving skills.
