INST326 Week 4 AI Journal

This week I used AI in several ways to help me with my classes. When I was studying, I asked it to break down difficult concepts into simpler steps, which made the material easier to understand. It also supported me with my homework by guiding me through problems and helping me check if my answers were correct. For one of my coding assignments, I turned to AI to debug my work, and it was able to point out errors I had missed while also explaining how to fix them. I relied on it for writing as well, first to brainstorm ideas and organize them into an outline when I had trouble getting started, and later to proofread my draft so the grammar, clarity, and flow improved. Overall, this week AI was a valuable tool that supported me at different stages of my work, from studying and problem-solving to writing and editing.
